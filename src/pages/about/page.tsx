          I&apos;m passionate about the endless possibilities that software
          offers. The marvel of the digital world captivates me, with its
          astonishing blend of complexity and precision. Consider this: watching
          a video on YouTube, a seemingly effortless action, involves a stunning
          orchestration of events. Your computer sends a coded signal via Wi-Fi
          to your router. This signal is transformed into an electrical impulse,
          which then embarks on a journey through a labyrinth of switches and
          DNS servers. It finally reaches a YouTube server that understands your
          request and sends back data, retracing the path to your Wi-Fi router
          and then to your computer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Simultaneously, the browser&apos;s engine works like an indefatigable
          interpreter, transforming high-level languages into machine-readable
          code. This intricate dance of electrical signals and code is then
          managed by CPUs and GPUs, ultimately manifesting as a video on your
          screenâ€”all in the blink of an eye.
          <br />
          <br />
          Even this massive over-simplification of something that seems trivial
          (watching a youtube video), illustrates the beauty of our software
          infrastructure. Every one of the steps outlined above is extremely
          complicated. Yet, somehow it all works, and it works every time. I
          like learning about why that works. I like building on top of and
          contributing to that infrastructure to make products that someone will
          enjoy or find useful.

          Education and Experience

          I graduated from MIT in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a
          minor in Mathematics. My upper level classes focused more on the
          &quot;mathy&quot; side of CS (algorithms and ML). Outside of class I
          worked at the fitness center, was a member of GEL - an engineering
          leadership program, and was an officer for my fraternity. In the
          summers I held software engineering internships at companies of
          various sizes. After graduation I returned to Markforged, the company
          I interned at after my Junior year, to work full time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Markforged makes industrial grade 3D printers, and I&apos;m a member
          of the IoT team. We&apos;re responsible for the embedded application
          controlling high level printer functionality (sits between slicer
          software and firmware code). We touch a large portion of the software
          stack - directly responsible for the printers&apos; UI and backend
          application. We also work closely with teams who work on electrical
          component firmware and our custom Linux distribution.
          <br />
          <br />
          It has been invaluable experience learning how to maintain and work
          within a large software application. Outside of the technical skills,
          I&apos;ve learned a ton about best practices and how to manage long
          term projects. My favorite part of the job is being able to work with
          engineers across various disciplines on a daily basis. I&apos;m often
          interacting with electrical, mechanical, and materials engineers.

          Outside of work and personal projects/learnings I have a few hobbies.
          I enjoy watching sports - mainly hockey, baseball, and football.
          I&apos;m a big Buffalo sports fan, go Bills! I stay active playing
          golf, skiing, and going to the gym. At night I enjoy reading, and am
          always looking for new books (check out the reading tab). Recently,
          I&apos;ve been trying to write more, as I find it helps me organize my
          thoughts and deeply think about a subject (check out the blog tab).
          <br />
          <br />I love playing poker, and watch too many poker blogs on youtube.
          Some friends and I won a few prizes in the 2022 poker bots competition
          at MIT, so I guess they paid off. I enjoy fun mind puzzles - I do the
          sudoku and wordle every day. Lastly, I&apos;m trying to become a
          better cook, so I find myself watching a lot of cooking shows on
          youtube as well.
